# BloodRip (ProjectKorra Ability)
An extremely dark bloodbending move that allows you to bend the blood out of your enemies. You can even reuse their blood for other waterbending if you need to.

### Usage
Hold sneak while looking at a mob or player. Smoke particles will start to be emitted off the mob/player and red particles will be given off in your hand. Once fully charged, either release sneak or click and a great amount of damage will be dealt to them as their blood is ripped out.

If a mob or player dies from having their blood ripped out, **you can then reuse their blood was a water source for other moves**.

Note: If a player releases sneak/clicks when the move isn't fully charged, the damage is scaled depending on how charged the move was.

### Technical Stuff
In this ability, killing a player/mob with it draws their blood out and creates a "blood source". This is actually just an invisible water block that spawns blood particles eveyr 4(?) ticks. When there is no longer a water block there (e.g. a move has turned it to air since it has been used as a source), the blood source is removed.

### Lisense
You can copy, edit and redistribute all the code for BloodRip as long as you keep StrangeOne101 as one of the original authors. You may use parts of this code for your own abilities or plugins but don't have to credit me as long as your project isn't based off this one.
